Welcome to my developer portfolio! This project showcases my skills, projects, and experience as a developer. Built with [React](https://react.dev/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), and [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/), it not only provides a visually appealing representation of my work but also ensures optimal performance.
